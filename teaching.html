    <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
    
    <div class="philosophy">
      <p>My teaching philosophy centers on making complex technical concepts accessible and engaging through hands-on learning and real-world applications. I believe in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Active Learning:</strong> Creating interactive experiences like the "Ollie the Otter" AWS tutorial that transform abstract concepts into memorable adventures</li>
        <li><strong>Ethical Integration:</strong> Weaving discussions of ethics and bias throughout technical instruction, particularly in AI and data science contexts</li>
        <li><strong>Inclusive Education:</strong> Designing learning experiences that welcome students from diverse backgrounds and skill levels</li>
        <li><strong>Practical Application:</strong> Connecting classroom learning to real-world problems in animal welfare, technology, and social responsibility</li>
      </ul>

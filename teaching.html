<h1>Teaching</h1>

<p>My teaching philosophy centers on making AI and data science accessible to all, especially minorities and
  marginalized populations. I help bridge technical rigor with ethical responsibility through hands-on projects that
  tackles real-world problems. I create inclusive learning environments where diverse perspectives meet and strengthen
  our collective understanding of technology's impact on society. Through mentorship and critical thinking, I help
  students become not just skilled practitioners who know "how to", but thoughtful leaders who ask "should we?", and
  recognize that ethical AI development requires both technical excellence and social responsibility.</p>

<h1>Projects</h1>

<p>I believe in making research reproducible and accessible to all. Here are some of my open-source projects that bridge AI, data science, and animal welfare science.</p>

    <div class="project-title">AI's Representation Bias in Livestock Farming</div>
    <div class="project-description">
        <p>Due to biases embedded in the prompt revision process, text-to-image generative AI systematically romanticized livestock farming as dairy cows grazing on pasture and pigs rooting in mud, even when asked for realistic depictions. Inhibiting prompt revision resulted in images that more closely reflected modern farming practices: cows housed indoors accessing feed through metal headlocks, and pigs behind metal railings on concrete floors. These findings reveal how prompt revision systematically promotes certain ideologies while erasing the reality.</p>
        <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Python, OpenAI API, Docker, GNU Make, statistical analysis</p>
        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> First comprehensive study of the bias of text-to-image generative AI in depicting farm animals</p>

    <div class="project-title">Competition Dominance Analysis</div>
    <div class="project-description">
        <p>This thoroughly documented and well-organized R project uses a Bayesian statistical framework to examine how feed competition influences the structure of dominance hierarchies in dairy cattle. I used an algorithm to automatically detect displacement behaviors at the feeder, analyzing data from 159 cows over a 10-month period.</p>
        <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> R, Bayesian modeling, Elo-rating,automated behavior detection</p>
        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> First study to demonstrate that competition flattens dominance hierarchies</p>

    <div class="project-title">Lameness Hierarchy</div>
    <div class="project-description">
        <p>This project integrates Python, R, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript to develop an innovative lameness assessment tool for dairy cows using Amazon MTurk. Similar in concept to the chatbot arena for ranking generative AI models, our system ranks cows based on the severity of lameness. Crowd workers perform pairwise comparisons judging which cow is more lame when watching two cows walking side by side.</p>
        <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Python, R, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Amazon MTurk, AWS, Bayesian Elo-rating</p>
        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Revolutionized lameness assessment by enabling reliable, scalable, and cost-effective assessment</p>

<h2>Open Source Philosophy</h2>

<p>I believe in the power of open science and reproducible research. My projects include:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 2rem; color: #555; line-height: 1.7;">
    <li><strong>Comprehensive documentation</strong> - Clear README files, vignettes, and code comments</li>
    <li><strong>Reproducible workflows</strong> - Docker containers, conda locks, environment files, and step-by-step instructions</li>
    <li><strong>Clean, well-organized code</strong> - Following best practices for maintainability</li>
    <li><strong>Data and model transparency</strong> - Where possible, sharing datasets and model weights</li>
    <li><strong>Educational value</strong> - Code that others can learn from and build upon</li>
</ul>

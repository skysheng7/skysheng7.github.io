% Note: each section of this table (Education, Awards, Publications etc.) is 
% stored in a two-column table. The left-hand column is narrow (1 inch) and is 
% meant to store dates. The right-hand column is wide (5.2 inches) and stores 
% the main text.  Sections in which each entry might have multiple lines 
% (e.g., Education) are stored in a 'SectionTable' environment). Sections in 
% which each entry might just have one line are stored in a 'SectionTableSingleSpace'

\begin{SectionTable}{\headingfont About Me}
& I'm passionate about using AI to empower marginalized communities and address real-world challenges. As a PhD candidate at UBC animal welfare program and a collaborator at TrustML, I conduct interdisciplinary research bridging \textbf{AI bias}, \textbf{animal welfare science}, and \textbf{data science}. My previous research includes automated dairy cow behavior monitoring, dominance hierarchy calculations, and automated lameness detection. Currently, I explore biases and tranparency issues in generative AI. I believe it's crucial that we don't lose the voices of those not in power and making them invisible behind numeric machines through coded gaze. I strive to make my research fully reproducible and accessible to all.

2025/2 -- 2025/6 &
\textbf{\href{https://skysheng7.github.io/moo4feed/}{R package: moo4feed}} \socialicon{\faGithub}  \newline
moo4feed is an R package designed to extract novel individual-level traits from raw feeding and drinking data collected through precision livestock farming systems. The package aims to support animal welfare research and data-driven monitoring by enabling reproducible, scalable analysis workflows. \\
2024/10 -- 2025/2 &
\textbf{\href{https://github.com/skysheng7/AI_bias_in_farming.git}{AI's representation bias about livestock farming}} \socialicon{\faGithub}  \newline
To evaluate text-to-image generative AI's depiction of how farm animals are raised, I designed 48 prompts and created 4800 dairy and pig farm images using DALL-E 3. This study reveals that DALL-E 3 is systematically biased towards romanticizing livestock farming as dairy cows grazing on pasture and pigs rooting in mud, even when explicitly prompted for realistic depictions. When automatic prompt revision was disabled, the generated images better reflected modern intensive farming practices. While prompt revision was implemented to mitigate bias, it paradoxically erased intensive farming reality and misled the public to believe that farmed animals live extensively. The analysis is fully reproducible via a customized Docker image and GNU Make workflow. \\
2023/1 -- 2024/3 &
\textbf{\href{https://github.com/skysheng7/competition_dominance_analysis}{Competition Dominance Analysis}} \socialicon{\faGithub}  \newline
This thoroughly documented and well-organized R project uses a Bayesian statistical framework to examine how feed competition influences the structure of dominance hierarchies in dairy cattle. I used an algorithm to automatically detect displacement behaviors at the feeder, analyzing data from 159 cows over a 10-month period. This study is the first to demonstrate that high competition periods are linked to a flattening of the dominance hierarchy, driven by subordinate cows becoming more successful at displacing herd mates when access to resources is limited. Our findings suggest that dominance hierarchies based on agonistic behaviors during high-competition periods better reflect cowsâ€™ motivation for fresh feed rather than their inherent dominance traits. \\
2023/7 -- 2025/2 &
\textbf{\href{https://github.com/skysheng7/lameness_hierarchy}{Lameness Hierarchy}} \socialicon{\faGithub} \newline
This project integrates Python, R, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript to develop an innovative lameness assessment tool for dairy cows using Amazon MTurk. Lameness in dairy cows is a painful condition that affects their ability to walk normally. Similar in concept to the \text{\href{https://lmarena.ai/}{chatbot arena}} for ranking generative AI models, our system ranks cows based on the severity of lameness. Crowd workers perform pairwise comparisons judging which cow is more lame when watching two cows walking side by side, and the results are analyzed using the Elo-rating method within a Bayesian framework to rank cows from the most healthy to the most lame. This approach enables early detection of mobility issues, supports timely treatment, and reduces prolonged pain. The results demonstrated that untrained crowd workers can achieve accuracy comparable to trained experts. Additionally, a subsampling algorithm reduces the number of required comparisons while maintaining ranking accuracy, providing a scalable, cost-effective solution for generating high-quality training datasets to improve automated lameness detection models.\\
2024/2 -- 2024/7 &
\textbf{\href{https://github.com/skysheng7/welfare_assess_GPT4o}{Welfare Assessment using GPT-4o}} \socialicon{\faGithub} \newline
This project, developed in Python and R, evaluates cow welfare through automated image analysis using GPT-4o and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). This study investigated whether GPT-4o can achieve expert-level accuracy in assessing cow cleanliness (hind leg, hindquarter, udder) after being provided with the Welfare Quality Protocol manual and two example images per category. To enhance accuracy, I explored different prompting strategies and image processing techniques, such as applying bounding boxes to highlight areas of interest and using segmentation to isolate specific body parts. Data analysis showed that segmentation and bounding boxes improved model performance by reducing bias towards labeling cows as dirty. This approach highlights the potential of AI-driven visual assessments for more efficient and real-time animal welfare evaluations. \\
2022/9 -- 2022/12 &
\textbf{\href{https://github.com/skysheng7/Lameness-prediction-ML.git}{Lameness Prediction through Machine Learning}} \socialicon{\faGithub} \newline
This project applies various machine learning methods, including Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Logistic Regression, to predict lameness in dairy cows based on behavioral data. Using data from 34 lame and 100 healthy cows over 10 months, we analyzed the impact of data preprocessing techniques such as undersampling, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction on model performance. The study demonstrated that weekly aggregated data and balanced sampling significantly improve predictive accuracy. This work highlights the potential of machine learning for early, automated lameness detection in precision livestock farming. \newline
